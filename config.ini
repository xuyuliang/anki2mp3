[symbol_pronounce]
; these are some rules for pronoucation. because your TTS wouldn't pronouce the symbols like '~' 'adj.' correctly
; and maybe you used lots of symbols in your anki notes for convenience
; you should manually replace them to "real world" words, if you find the result mp3 sounds weird. 
; tip (1) 
; be careful to the orders. for example , if you place '~':'word a' before '~=':'word b', '~=' would never be replaced defacto
; because the symbol '~' would have been replaced by the first rule and become 'word a='
; tip (2)
; the word below 'currword' has a special usage . it represents the key word in your current card
; for example. the current card's front page is 'apple' and back page is 'an red fruit. I like ~ '
; use rule '~':currword+' ' ,can replace it to 'an red fruit. I like apple'
; tip (3)
; fell free to add or delete rules below. my rules are not suitable for you.  
; the basic structure is {'symbol':'your replacement','another symbol':'another replacement'} ,you can use one line or several.
