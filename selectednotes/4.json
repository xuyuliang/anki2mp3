Meaning \"a trace (of something)\" is attested from 1530s. 2 \"smart, sharp sound made by the lips,\" 1560s, from  smack ,  v. 1. Meaning \"a loud kiss\" is recorded from c.1600. Meaning \"sharp sound made by hitting something with the flat of the hand\" is from c.1746. 3 single-masted sailboat, 1610s, probably from Dutch or Low German  smak  \"sailboat,\" perhaps from  smakken  \"to fling, dash\" (see  smack ,  v. 2), perhaps so-called from the sound made by its sails. French  semaque , Spanish  zumaca , Italian  semacca  probably are Germanic borrowings. 4 \"heroin,\" 1942, American English slang, probably an alteration of  schmeck  \"a drug,\" especially heroin (1932), from Yiddish  schmeck  \"a sniff.\" v. 1 \"make a sharp noise with the lips,\" 1550s, probably of imitative origin (see  smack ,  v. 2). With adverbial force, \"suddenly, directly,\" from 1782; extended form  smack-dab  is attested from 1892, American English colloquial ( slap-dab  is from 1886). 2 \"to slap a flat surface with the hand,\" 1835, from  smack ,  n.  in this sense; perhaps influenced by Low German  smacken  \"to strike, throw,\" which is likely of imitative origin (compare Swedish  smak  \"slap,\" Middle Low German  smacken , Frisian  smakke , Dutch  smakken  \"to fling down,\" Lithuanian  smagiu  \"to strike, knock down, whip\"). 3 mid-13c., \"to smell (something\"); mid-14c., \"to taste (something), perceive by taste\" (transitive); late 14c. \"to have a taste, taste of\" (intransitive), from  smack ,  n. 1. Compare Old English  smæccan  \"to taste,\" Old Frisian  smakia  Middle Dutch  smaecken , Old High German  smakken  \"have a savor, scent, or taste,\" German  schmecken  \"taste, try, smell, perceive.\" Sometimes also  smatch . Now mainly in verbal figurative use  smacks of ...  (first attested 1590s). \"Commonly but erroneously regarded as identical with [ smack ,  n. 2], as if 'taste' proceeds from 'smacking the lips.'\" [Century Dictionary]"
