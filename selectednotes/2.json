Old English  græf  \"grave, ditch, cave,\" from Proto-Germanic  *graban  (cognates: Old Saxon  graf , Old Frisian  gref , Old High German  grab  \"grave, tomb;\" Old Norse  gröf  \"cave,\" Gothic  graba  \"ditch\"), from PIE root  *ghrebh-  (2) \"to dig, to scratch, to scrape\" (source also of Old Church Slavonic  grobu  \"grave, tomb\"); related to Old English  grafan  \"to dig\" (see  grave ,  v. ). \"The normal mod. representation of OE.  græf  would be  graff ; the ME. disyllable  grave , from which the standard mod. form descends, was prob. due to the especially frequent occurrence of the word in the dat. (locative) case.  [OED] From Middle Ages to 17c., they were temporary, crudely marked repositories from which the bones were removed to ossuaries after some years and the grave used for a fresh burial. \"Perpetual graves\" became common from c.1650. To  make (someone) turn in his grave  \"behave in some way that would have offended the dead person\" is first recorded 1888. adj. 1540s, from Middle French  grave  (14c.), from Latin  gravis  \"weighty, serious, heavy, grievous, oppressive,\" from PIE root  *gwere-  (2) \"heavy\" (cognates: Sanskrit  guruh  \"heavy, weighty, venerable;\" Greek  baros  \"weight,\"  barys  \"heavy in weight,\" often with the notion of \"strength, force;\" Old English  cweorn  \"quern;\" Gothic  kaurus  \"heavy;\" Lettish  gruts  \"heavy\"). Greek  barys  (opposed to  kouphos ) also was used figuratively, of suffering, sorrow, sobbing, and could mean \"oppressive, burdensome, grave, dignified, impressive.\" The noun meaning \"accent mark over a vowel\" is c.1600, from French. v. \"to engrave,\" Old English  grafan  (medial  -f-  pronounced as \"v\" in Old English; past tense  grof , past participle  grafen ) \"to dig, carve, dig up,\" from Proto-Germanic  *grabanan  (cognates: Old Norse  grafa , Old Frisian  greva , Dutch  graven , Old High German  graban , German  graben , Gothic  graban  \"to dig, carve\"), from the same source as  grave ,  n. . Its Middle English strong past participle,  graven , is the only part still active, the rest of the word supplanted by its derivative,  engrave . 〔李〕[grav;-e] a.严重的，重大的    ←grav (L gravis)=heavy 重的 〔蒋〕[grav重] 重大的，严重的"
