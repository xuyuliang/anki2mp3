# anki2mp3
## purpose
When I finished my daily Anki, I will mark almost 60 to 80 cards for review. It will cost me maybe one or two hours do nothing but sit there. 
I wrote a piece of code, transfer the cards into one or two mp3 file with lyrics. at least, my hands are free, I can  do some chores with my earphone.

## introduction
1. Anki export cards(notes).

2.save this exported file(Selected Notes.txt) to "root" folder (the folder where tts.py exists)

3.run tts.py (after you setup venv and install all the required imports)

4.you will defintely find some error. fix them, and you will have an mp3 file generated by TTS and it's rylic file.

## fix tip:
* the only useful file is tts.py
* this program support TTS, gTTS and I copy some pronoucation mp3 from my local disk which you should disable and change it to TTS. gTTS is much better but the connection is very bad in my country. But I suggest you change the code, disable other engine, use gTTS.
